# Curvature
This repository contains a code for computing the mean curvature of a triangular surface mesh. 
The code uses the cotangent formula described in the journal article: 
Meyer, Mark, et al. "Discrete differential-geometry operators for triangulated 2-manifolds." Visualization and mathematics 3.2 (2002): 52-58.
